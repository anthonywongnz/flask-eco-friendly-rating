## Description
[“Food companies have not been innovators in sustainability, or any realm for that matter, unless they have a gun held to their heads.” - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hankcardello/2020/10/20/food-industry-is-a-no-show-in-new-sustainability-study/?sh=501454d91c57)

In a world learning to live with COVID-19, the food industry is struggling with lockdowns, restrictions and needing to reframe how their business operates. This is a great opportunity for businesses to reframe [“their strategic agenda not to return to business as it once was, but as a new platform from which to create and protect value” – Barry Perkins (EY Global Strategy and Transactions Lead Analyst) and Falco Weidemeyer (EMEIA EY-Parthenon Leader; EMEIA Reshaping Results Leader and Member of the Global Turnaround and Restructuring Strategy Leadership Team)](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ceo/the-ceo-imperative-rebound-to-more-sustainable-growth)

It is well known that customers are loyal to a business that aligns with their personal values and more and more people are valuing environmental efforts. We believe we need to provide businesses a way of clearly articulating their efforts and allowing consumers to easily compare between businesses.

Sussit is a cloud-based sustainability calculator that aims to provide consumers a whole picture view of how an eatery ranks in sustainability as well as food and service. It shows consumers not only the Google ratings but also the eatery’s sustainability scores to support a decision that aligns with consumers’ environmental goals. This will allow the consumer to ‘vote with their dollar’ and support businesses who are committed to environmental sustainability.

Once business owners list their eatery on the site, they can indicate basic information around delivery, takeaway, cuisine, their commitment to sustainability, etc. Scores around the eatery’s sustainability efforts are crowd sourced and weighted per category.

Customers will be able to indicate if the takeaway packaging is compostable, if the food is locally stored, if they have their own compost or herb garden etc. The data will be ingested and weighted to calculate the final sustainability score for the eatery.

The mid-term goal is to refine the algorithm, add a login (IBM Cloud App ID) and verification system so scores are not easily swayed by 1 bad review, add a search engine (IBM Watson), and expand and improve the functionalities of the site.

Existing solutions do not offer ratings driven by the consumer. Because businesses are constantly evolving, they are not always be able to keep up with their environmental commitments. This is where Sussit can help track their performance at a much faster rate by listening to what the consumers are saying. This helps remove the barrier between what a company promises, and the reality of how they operate.

An Asia-Pacific effort, our team of four wanted to help people make better decisions. How else could we refocus businesses and consumers on the long-term impact of their decisions instead of short-term commercial gains? Then came the idea of a tool to help consumers Sussit out. From dining options to retailers, the opportunities are unlimited. Or so we think. Let's start with dining and see where we go.
